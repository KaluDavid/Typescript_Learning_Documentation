/**
 * Array Type Inference
9 min
TypeScript can infer variable types from initial values and return statements. Even still, we may not know exactly what type inference to expect when dealing with

arrays
. For example:

let examAnswers= [true, false, false];


What is the type of examAnswers? It seems it could equally well be boolean[] or [boolean, boolean, boolean]. In reality, it is always the first of these, since this is the less restrictive type. This enables us to expand the array:

examAnswers[3] = true; // No type error.


Since

tuples
 have fixed lengths, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to add additional boolean elements to a tuple:

let tupleOfExamAnswers: [boolean, boolean, boolean] = [true, false, false];
tupleOfExamAnswers[3] = true; // Type error! The tuple only has 3 elements.


We also get the same kind of type inference when we use the .concat() method:
*/

let tup: [number, number, number] = [1, 2, 3];
let concatResult = tup.concat([4, 5, 6]); // concatResult has the value [1,2,3,4,5,6].

/*
In the code above, TypeScript infers the variable concatResult as an array of numbers, not a tuple.

The takeaway here is that type inference returns arrays. When we want tuples, we need to use explicit

/*Let‚Äôs do a tricky example. We have defined the tuple dogTup in the code editor. Your challenge is to define a variable myArr of the type string[].

Not so fast! The hard part is that you are not allowed to use the word Array, or the characters[and].Use the.concat() method and your wits to solve the problem.

// Don't change this part:
let dogTup: [string, string, string, string] = [

// Your code goes here:

let myArr = dogTup.concat("black", "huge", "fat");
